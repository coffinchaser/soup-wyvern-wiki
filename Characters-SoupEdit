# Creating a Character in WyvernChat

Welcome to the **Character Creation Guide** for WyvernChat! This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first character, enabling engaging and interactive chats. Customize everything—from your character's **appearance and backstory** to their **unique personality traits**.

---

## Required vs. Optional Fields

- **Fields marked in orange** are **required** to create a character.
- All other fields are optional but allow you to add depth and personality.

---

## Character Profile

### Profile Photo

- **Purpose:** Upload an image to give your character a face. If the image contains metadata, character details may import automatically; otherwise, it serves as the avatar.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Aspect ratio: **109:214**
  - Format: **PNG**
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check file size and format compatibility if the image fails to upload.
  - Ensure the file is a valid PNG.

### Name

- **Purpose:** The name identifies your character in the system and appears on the character card. If no **Chat Name** is provided, this field replaces the placeholder `{{char}}`.
- **Example:** Johnathan Doe
- **Need inspiration?** Explore Fantasy Name Generators.

### Chat Name

- **Purpose:** Identifies your character in the system and replaces the placeholder `{{char}}`.
- **Example:** Use "Joe" instead of "Johnathan Doe."

### Character Sprites

- **Purpose:** Visual aids showing your character's emotions in the chat interface, similar to illustrations in light novels.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Image size: **1024x1536**
  - Position the face in the **upper 40%** of the image to avoid text overlap in mobile views.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Ensure the image dimensions meet recommendations.
  - Check face positioning to prevent parts from being obscured.

### Model (Optional)

#### 3D Model (VRM Format)

- **Purpose:** Upload a VRM model for an interactive experience. These digital avatars animate movements and facial expressions based on the character's emotion.
  - Typical animated expressions: neutral, smiling, sad, angry, happy, surprised, closed, closed eye (left), closed eye (right), vowels (A, I, U, E, O).
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Validate VRM files with tools like **Unity** or **VRoid Studio**.

### Profile Bio

- **Purpose:** Capture your character’s essence with a short, engaging description. This is also a good place to include tidbits like a known character trope (tsundere, childhood friend, isekai), character series, original sources, or participation in WyvernChat events.
- **Examples:**
  - Fantasy Adventurer: *"A rogue thief from Eldarath seeking redemption after a life of crime."*
  - Sci-Fi Explorer: *"Captain of the SS Voyager, navigating uncharted galaxies in search of alien civilizations."*

### Profile Background

- **Function:** Set a background image for your character’s full-screen card or use it during chats.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Choose a background that complements your character's theme (e.g., a castle for a knight, a starfield for a space explorer).

## Card Details

### Placeholders

Add dynamic elements for personalized interactions:

- `{{user}}`: Refers to the user's name.
- `{{char}}`: Refers to the character's name.

### Character Details

1. **Description:** Outline appearance, personality, motives, and quirks.

   - Example: *"{{char}} always twirls their pen when thinking and quotes poetry unexpectedly."*

2. **Example Scenes:** Showcase how your character interacts.

   - Example: *[Scene: A quiet coffee shop. {{char}} sips a latte by the window on a rainy evening.]*

3. **Multi-Turn Example Dialogues:**

   - **Standard Interaction Example:**
     ```
     {{user}}: "What’s the best book you’ve read recently?"
     {{char}}: "Ah, that would be 'The Art of War.' A timeless masterpiece. Have you read it?"
     {{user}}: "Not yet. Do you recommend it?"
     {{char}}: "Absolutely. It teaches strategy, but I must warn you—it’s more about philosophy than tactics."
     ```
   - **High-Stakes Interaction Example:**
     ```
     {{user}}: "We’re running out of time. What should we do?"
     {{char}}: "Calm down. Let’s evaluate our options logically. If we rush, we might overlook something critical."
     {{user}}: "But we don’t have all the details yet!"
     {{char}}: "Exactly. That’s why gathering intel is the priority. I’ll handle reconnaissance—you stay here and prepare the fallback plan."
     ```
   - **Emotional Interaction Example:**
     ```
     {{user}}: "I feel like I’ve failed everyone."
     {{char}}: "Hey, listen to me. Failure isn’t the end—it’s a step toward growth. What matters is how you rise after falling."
     {{user}}: "It’s not that simple."
     {{char}}: "I know it’s not, but you don’t have to do it alone. Lean on me, and we’ll face this together."
     ```

4. **Character Notes:** Summarize key traits succinctly.

   - Example:
     ```
     {{char}}: height(6'2"), hair(black, short), personality(charming but aloof), likes(puzzles, sunsets), dislikes(rude people).
     ```

## Scenario Details

### Scenario Setup

- **Function:** Create an immersive setting for interactions.
- **Example:**
  ```
  Era: near future (2045, post-technological singularity); Location: Neo Tokyo (megacity, floating districts); Setting: cyberpunk (high tech, low life), dystopian (corporate control)
  ```
- **Note:** Use this field for overarching world information that won’t change during the conversation. Avoid over-defining the scene, which could block organic development.

### Default First Message

- **Function:** The initial message users see when interacting with your character.
- **Example:** *"You know, there’s something poetic about raindrops—it’s like nature’s heartbeat."*

### Alternate Greetings

- **Purpose:** Add variety with alternate first messages.
- **Examples:**
  - Seasonal: *"Merry Christmas, {{user}}! Care for some hot cocoa?"*
  - Mood-Specific: *"It’s a stormy night, {{user}}. Perfect weather for a ghost story."*
